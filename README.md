This is a "jeopardy dice game" in which the dominant decision is whether or not to jeopardize your previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. 

                                             # Rules and Procedures
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls two dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
1. If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
2. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
3. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. 
4. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 120(default winning target) or players' set target wins.
