# dadu
Dadu is a Swahili word for ‘I play’. I implement it here as a strategy game, a version of dice game for two players. Wachezaji(players) plays “rounds”. It allows players to play as many times as they want to accumulate points in each round. Winning points here is 102. Players choose to ‘hold’ to protect their points in each round or risk losing all if they score ONE in a round.
