# dadu
Dadu is a Swahili word for ‘I play’. I implement it here as a strategy game, a version of dice game for two players. Wachezaji(players) plays “rounds”. It allows players to play as many times as they want to accumulate points in each round. Winning points here is 102. Players choose to ‘hold’ to protect their points in each round or risk losing all if they score ONE in a round. 

# Rules and Procedures
1. There are 2 players.
2. Each player's turn to play is called a ROUND.
3. Each player's score is displayed GLOBALLY. 
4. Each player rolls a dice during their round as many times as they want.
5. Each round score is added to the global score.
6. If a round score is higher that the global score, then that player wins the Dadu
7. If a play score a ONE in a round, they lose all points in that round
8. A play can choose to keep playing and risk losing all round points or 'hold' to add round points to global points.
9. Choosing a hold allows the second player to play.
